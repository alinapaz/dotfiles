## Installing packages with Homebrew

Most development tools can and should be installed via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), for example:

- chruby (for changing Ruby versions): `brew install chruby`
- ruby-install (for installing new Ruby versions): `brew install ruby-install`
- Nodejs: `brew install node`

To update Homebrew itself `brew update`.
